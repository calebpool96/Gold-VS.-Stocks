As you can tell by the Viz as the amount of Volume on the market plays a big role in the price. 
Gold is also on a downwards trend in volume so although the price will keep going up if more Volume is involved the price will plummit.

## AVG High & Low Vs Volume (Top 5 Stocks)

From this Viz it would appear the Volume doesnt effect the price of stocks as much as gold.
We can also see that on average those who bought Microsoft Stocks yeilded the best 5 year return.

## Highest Vs. Lowest (Stocks Sold)

This is the best-case scenerio (You bought the stock at the lowest price and sold at the highest price).
Notice that Microsoft has the biggest spread.

This the same scenario as the last KPI but this is with Gold.

## Gold Vs. Microsoft (Best Case Scenerio)
## Gold bought at: $1,161.4 and sold at $2,072
2072-1161.4=910.6. 
### $910.6 Profit
## Microsoft Bought at $87.5 and sold at $349.7
349.7-87.5=262.2. 
### $262.2 Profit
## Microsoft stocks bought at low with gold low
1161.4/87.5=13.3 stocks
## Those Stocks Sold at Microsoft stocks high
13.3*349.7=4651.01-1161.4=3489.61. 
### $3,489.61 Profit

## Thereby Microsoft had the most possibility to make money.
